### [Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/use-a-mixin-to-add-common-behavior-between-unrelated-objects)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Just like the `flyMixin` function, a new `glideMixin` function must be made to accept both `bird` and `boat` objects as a parameter.  Create this new function using the same syntax as the `flyMixin` function and then call the function on both objects.
